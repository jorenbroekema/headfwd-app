# HeadFWD

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project

## Improvements

- Make the combobox search behave more reliably
- Fetch pictures from Spotify API using the spotifyIds, the app looks a bit bland without it
- Make catalogue which will have a combobox that allows searching for songs, albums and artists
- Add more unit tests
